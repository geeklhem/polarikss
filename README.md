Polarity Kept Stupidly Simple : A small modelling project for the 2014
Dresden Summer School in Systems Biology

We tried developing a quantitative model for cell polarity
establishment in a single-cell C. elegans embryo.

This model is often described using two population of proteins with
antagonistic interactions, but we tried to make it simpler by
modelling two populations of proteins *without interactions* but with
different diffusion and advection coefficients.


You can download the ipython notebook to try our model interactively
on your computer or visualize the non interactive version at
