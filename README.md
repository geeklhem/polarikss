polarikss : Polarity Kept Stupidly Simple
==========================================
*A small modelling project for the 2014 Dresden Summer School in Systems Biology*

We tried developing a quantitative model for cell polarity
establishment in a single-cell C. elegans embryo.

This model is often described using two population of proteins with
antagonistic interactions, but we tried to make it simpler by
modelling two populations of proteins **without interactions** but with
different diffusion and advection coefficients.


You can download the ipython notebook to try our model interactively
on your computer or visualize the non interactive version at
http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/geeklhem/polarikss/tree/master/

If you want to use it on your computer the dependencies are:
- the python libraries: numpy, scipy, pandas, matplotlib.
- for the verifications and the flow speed input: as these are unpublished data, we cannot disclose them at the moment.
